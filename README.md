Based off Adafruit_VEML7700 [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VEML7700/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VEML7700/actions)
================

Re-written abient light measurement algorithm that uses standard deviation samples for more accurate Lux measurements in the field.

MAX RESOLUTION CONFIGURED FOR CUSTOM LENSING. LUX VALUES WILL BE INACCURATE BASED ON THE LENSING USED WITH THIS LIBRARY.

Tested and works great with the [Adafruit VEML7700 Breakout Board](http://www.adafruit.com/)

This chip uses I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface
